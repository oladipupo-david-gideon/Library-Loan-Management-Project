This part of the project wasn’t too taxing, as we were just building on our previous one. I spent an estimated time of nine hours on this project. I started working on it on April 15, 2025, and finished it on April 23, 2025. It didn’t feel too difficult because I had a general idea of what I needed to do; I just had to put it together. The hardest part of the project for me was implementing my old functions to work for the new arrangement of classes and derived classes. I learned more about inheritance and how it makes the code more efficient when dealing with multiple types of objects. I split my work time over 5 days, making it easier to complete the project and keeping my creativity fresh. It’s more fun to code when you don’t do it all at once and have a guideline to follow. I had fun during the project, and the opportunity to apply what we learn in class to real-world scenarios is very beneficial to me.
